DONE:
- Back to main menu after game allows for replayability
- If last person in the room, end game

TODO:
- In game menu for leave game
- Player leaves a four player game
- Register player stats after gameover


TO FIX:
- New player connecting to a post-game room ends up adding themselves to a dictionary twice, both on Awake
  and on JoinedRoom, need a boolean or some kind of distinguishing feature to indicate post game room or just joined.
- New player connecting to a post-game room who then leaves causes a NRE.
- Player 1 leaves a room and the player index doesnt change, need to reset player ID's when returning to room view.
