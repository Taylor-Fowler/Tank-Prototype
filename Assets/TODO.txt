DONE:
- Back to main menu after game allows for replayability
- If last person in the room, end game
- Register player stats after gameover

TODO:
- In game menu for leave game
- Player leaves a four player game


- Adjust player ID's on return to room view
Possibilities:
4 Player Room
2 and 3 in room (0 and 1 left)
1, 2 and 3 in room (0 left)



TO FIX:
- New player connecting to a post-game room ends up adding themselves to a dictionary twice, both on Awake
  and on JoinedRoom, need a boolean or some kind of distinguishing feature to indicate post game room or just joined.
- New player connecting to a post-game room who then leaves causes a NRE.


Current Problem:
- Game starts, one player leaves, return to room
- Player that returns to room has their colour button selected
- New player joins room, existing players colour button does not register as selected
- New player can now select colour that existing player owns

Fix:
- Added an N to a button when it has been unselected! So either the button is being selected and
then unselected OR just not being selected at all
	- Uncommented the Unselect from OnRemoteChangePlayerColour...didn't solve
- Manually dragged the BITCombos into the inspector
- Adjusted the wait timer to make sure that buttons and player was initialised correctly
- Added functionality to manually update the buttons for players already in the room (which are initialised)
- I believe that setting player properties within a room is a buffered network command, so before a game
all players receive the buffered property updates (triggering updates to the buttons)...but at the end
of a game, PhotonNetwork.DestroyAll is called which effectively destroys the buffer. This resulted in new players
not receiving the buffered commands and not selecting the buttons for pre-existing players.
